Basic calculator with the following functions:

Add (num1 + num2,
Subtract (num1 - num2),
Multiply (num1 * num2),
Divide (num1 / num2),
Modulus (num1 % num2),
Left Shift (num1 << num2),
Right Shift (num1 >> num2),
Bitwise AND (num1 & num2),
Bitwise OR (num1 | num2),
Bitwise XOR (num1 ^ num2),
Bitwise Inverse (~num1)

This code supports two integers and a character as inputs, and outputs an integer.
The two integers are the two numbers to be manipulated by the program.
The character is used to determine what operation is being performed. 
DOUBLES CAN NOT BE USED IN THIS PROGRAM

the file being used in this program is the math.h header file which allows the creation of a math class.

There are no extra libraries being used besides the standard C libraries.
